# FsNuGet

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9dqouk9q20g2jore)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/t0yv0/fsnuget)

Grown out of frustration with `NuGet.Core.dll`, this little lib allows
for basic operations, such as checking out latest version of a NuGet
package from the official repository and unpacking it to a local
folder.

Unlike `NuGet.Core.dll`, tries to be lightweight and to work on Mono.

* NuGet package: [FsNuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FsNuGet)
